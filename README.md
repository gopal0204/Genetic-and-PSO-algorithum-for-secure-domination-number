## Domination Set: 
A subset S of V is called a dominating set of graph G if every vertex in V\S is adjacent to a vertex in S and the minimum cardinality of S is the domination number of the graph G denoted by γ(G).




## Secure Domination Set:
 A dominating set S ⊆ V(G)is said to be a Secure Dominating Set (SDS) in G if for every u ∈ V(G)\S there exists v ∈ S such that (u,v)∈ E(G)and (S \{v})∪{u} is a dominating set in G. The secure domination number of graph G is the minimum cardinality of a SDS, and is denoted by γs(G).
